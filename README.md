# Emacs and Python

![emacs startup screen](screenshots/emacs_startup_screen.png)

I've been having a pretty good time with [Emacs][], and I'd like to
tell you about it. Python is one of the things that Emacs is good for,
and I'll get to that. But I'm going to try to do a pretty broad survey
of why Emacs makes me happy.

[Emacs]: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/

I've been using Emacs for around 20 years, so I'm still a newbie.
That's partially a joke, but it's also true that I've only started to
get into using Emacs well in the past several months. There are
probably several people here who are better with Emacs than me. I look
forward to getting your feedback and advice for improving.

All my configuration is in my [.emacs.d](https://github.com/ajschumacher/.emacs.d).
