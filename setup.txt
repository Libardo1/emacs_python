It's a little Inception:


Repo setup:

git clone git@github.com:ajschumacher/dcpython-django.git django-safe
(at 77af075)

git clone git@github.com:ajschumacher/tset.git
(at 710628d)
cp -r tset tset-safe

git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
(at e579171)
cp -r scikit-learn scikit-learn-safe


Browser setup:

Three tabs:
https://github.com/DCPython/dcpython-django
https://github.com/ajschumacher/dcpython-django
https://twitter.com/planarrowspace

Full screen, no tabs showing.


Shell setup:

Enter this once so that it'll be in the command history:
`grep -o '\w*grep' ~/.bashrc | sort | uniq -c`


Process 1:

`e`
`M-x twittering-mode`
`u` to open compose tweet
Kill the tweet-listing buffer.

Put in kill ring:

"""
"Your father's lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster. A more elegant weapon for a more civilized age."
- Obi Wan Kenobi, Star Wars: A New Hope
"""

"""
#Emacs and #Python at @DCPython! Readable presentation: https://github.com/ajschumacher/emacs_python/blob/master/README.md Featuring 26 screenshots, Tetris, Nyan Cat, and this tweet!
"""

In scratch buffer, put 78 characters across the screen.

Now `C-x C-z` leaves one Emacs daemon and no clients.


Process 2:

Start a separate Emacs process with `emacs`.

My current email setup is just for sending email, and it prompts for a
password at least once per session. So send a throw-away email (C-x m)
before the demo starts, to hopefully save having to type it a password
live.

Then, set up to send this email:

To:
"""
Eddie Welker <eddie.welker@gmail.com>
"""

Subject:
"""
thanks!
"""

Body:
"""
Hi Eddie!

Thanks for having me present at DC Python! It's always a great event, and a great audience - thanks for organizing it. I just hope I don't mess up too much, trying to do everything live!

I've got all the materials from the talk online already, and I'll tweet out a link at the end of the presentation.

Thanks again! Best,
"""

Background with `C-z`.


Process 3:

Start a third Emacs with `emacs`. It should be at the startup screen.
If there's any problem, get the startup screen with
`(display-startup-screen)`.

Background with `C-z`.


Process 4:

Open a graphical Emacs client with `eg`.

Check the right zoom level and number of columns and rows for the
graphical interface when going to full screen, to avoid fiddling
around too much when switching from console Emacs to graphical Emacs
launched from a shell in Emacs.

Remember settings, close graphical interface.


Process 5:

Open a terminal Emacs client with `emacs`.

Full-screen the terminal, zoom to a good size.

Close with `C-x C-c`.


Now there are three Emacs processes. One server, and two standalones.


Bring up the third with `fg.


Present.
