; thanks!
; Hi Eddie!
;
; Thanks for having me present at DC Python! It's always a great event,
; and a great audience - thanks for organizing it. I just hope I don't
; mess up too much, trying to do everything live!
;
; I've got all the materials from the talk online already, and I'll tweet
; out a link at the end of the presentation.
;
; Thanks again! Best,
